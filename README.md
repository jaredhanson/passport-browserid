[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) strategy for authenticating
with [BrowserID](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Persona).

This module lets you authenticate using BrowserID in your Node.js applications.
By plugging into Passport, BrowserID authentication can be easily and
unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports
[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including
[Express](http://expressjs.com/).

[BrowserID](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Persona) is an
open, decentralized protocol for authenticating users based on email addresses,
developed by [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/).  It is commonly associated with
[Persona](https://login.persona.org/), the brand used for Mozilla's
implementation of BrowserID.  This strategy performs local verification of
assertions, delivering on BrowserID's promise of ensuring user privacy.

## Install

    $ npm install passport-browserid

## Usage

#### Configure Strategy

The BrowserID authentication strategy authenticates users using an assertion of
email address ownership, obtained via the BrowserID JavaScript API.  The
strategy requires a `verify` callback, which accepts an email address and calls
`cb` providing a user.

    passport.use(new BrowserIDStrategy({
        audience: 'http://www.example.com'
      },
      function(email, cb) {
        User.findByEmail({ email: email }, function (err, user) {
          return cb(err, user);
        });
      }
    ));

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'browserid'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

    app.post('/auth/browserid', 
      passport.authenticate('browserid', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
      function(req, res) {
        // Successful authentication, redirect home.
        res.redirect('/');
      });

## Considerations

#### Specification

This module is implemented based on the specifications being developed by [Mozilla Identity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity),
which remain a work-in-progress and are *not* final.  Implementers are
encouraged to track the progress of these specifications and update update their
implementations as necessary.  Furthermore, the implications of relying on
non-final specifications should be understood prior to deployment.

While the specifications remain under development, it is recommended to use
Mozilla's [Remote Verification API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Persona/Remote_Verification_API).
This functionality is implemented by [passport-persona](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-persona).
